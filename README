This repository has a few files that show how to create webpages that display a gigapan image and a few thumbnails.  In particular, this pages show how to embed a gigapan image that takes a much greater advantage of the browser window and provides a few extra features that aren't in the standard embedding wizards or, AFAIK, documented anywhere else.

- Doesn't the gigapan website already have a wizard that does this?
Yes.  However, the code it produces is relatively limited (doesn't have a full-screen button, is kind of small, no snapshots, etc)

- Why not just view gigapans on the regular gigapan website?
IMHO, the default gigapan.org pages are a bit cluttered and don't take advantage of the maximum size of these typically very large images.  This code is intended to remove the clutter and focus on the image.

- Where did you get most of the code to do this?
I started from a forum post on the gigapan.org website (http://gigapan.org/forums/15/topics/64) and, inspired by some work done by one of the contributors ('tip of the hat to Ronnie Miranda), started hacking around with the different pieces to make my own pages.

The initial implementation involved a lot of copy/paste because I wasn't aware of the gigapan json APIs.  I stumbled on another forum post (http://gigapan.com/forums/14/topics/223) describing how to use these apis (another tip of the hat to forum contributor Jason Buchheim) and I started hacking again.

- Could this all break if the GigaPan folks change their code?
Yep.

- Why did you do XXX this way?  Are you some kind of php/html/css/js idiot?
Probably.  I'm a bit of a novice with web coding (I probably have just enough knowledge to be dangerous).  So, forgive my slash and hack efforts to get this all to work.  I'm posting this so that others with more refined web-coding skills will have the opportunity to clean it up (or throw it all-away) as appropriate.




So, how do I make this work?
-----------------------------
The php code takes a single parameter corresponding to the gigapan id.  For example:
http://www.saracino.com/gigapans/gigapan.large.php?id=98719


How does it get the data to be shown?
-------------------------------------
The code starts by looking at the "Stitcher Notes" associated with the gigapan id.  If that is empty (which is typical when using 3P stitchers like Autopano), the code looks at the contents of the "Description" associated with the id.  It assumes there is a block at the end of the description starting with "--Image Details--" and parses the remaining text as though it were the "Stitcher Notes" attached by the Gigapan stitching application.

Typically, I always make at least one stitching pass using the Gigapan Stitcher.  If I later decide to publish an image stitched using autopano I can copy the output of the original Gigapan stitcher pass (found by clicking on the "More Stitch Notes" button) into the contents of the "Description" field to ensure that the data travels with the image.
